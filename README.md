# Timer
This application provides functionality to control work/rest time. The user can start the timer, customize the appearance (color, font). Also in this application there is a functionality for adding data to session Storage (stores data that will not be deleted after reloading the page).

In this project I used:
+ React;
+ React hooks;
+ Redux, react-redux;

You can run this project locally just do:
+ `git clone https://github.com/saglushevich/timer.git`
+ `cd timer`
+ `npm install`
+ `npm start`
